                <p>Jupiter (Latin: Iūpiter or Iuppiter,[14] from Proto-Italic *djous "day, sky" + *patēr "father", thus
                    "sky
                    father" Greek: Δίας or Ζεύς),[15] also known as Jove (gen. Iovis [ˈjɔwɪs]), is the god of the sky
                    and
                    thunder, and king of the gods in ancient Roman religion and mythology. Jupiter was the chief deity
                    of Roman
                    state religion throughout the Republican and Imperial eras, until Christianity became the dominant
                    religion
                    of the Empire. In Roman mythology, he negotiates with Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, to
                    establish
                    principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.</p>
                <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with
                    a mass
                    more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and
                    slightly less
                    than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the
                    Earth's
                    night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named
                    after
                    Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.</p>
                <p>Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, followed by helium, which constitutes a quarter of its
                    mass and a
                    tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the
                    planet
                    receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, the planet's
                    shape is
                    an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is
                    divided
                    into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A
                    prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since at least
                    1831.
